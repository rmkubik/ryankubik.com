I figured that a game rooted in web technologies would be far easier to distribute, especially on the small scale I\'m working on. This is the result of my first foray into browser based game development. This game was written using Javascript using Phaser learning from a <a href="https://leanpub.com/null2full">tutorial</a> created by <a href="https://leanpub.com/u/triqui">Emanuele Feronato</a>.';

For our final project in the class, our group will be creating an arcade cabinet with a Raspberry Pi at its core. The goal is to optimize this game a little more to get it to a fun state to play before the end of the semester arrives. Hopefully this will also include an attempt at local multiplayer as well. For this game I also used graphics created by <a href="http://kenney.nl">Kenney</a> for game developers to use.';
